## App Installer

### Have you ever download an **AppImage** file ?

This type of binary has the advantage of being portable but it will not be present on your Desktop manager's applications list .

This tool written in Go allows to create app shrotcuts on the linux desktop environment and helps to better integrate appimages binaries to your system 

## Usage

```sh
> sudo appinstall AppImageFilePath
```
After the installation, the Appimage is no longer needed and can be deleted.
